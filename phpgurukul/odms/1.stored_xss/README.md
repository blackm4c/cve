## Vulnerability Overview

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS) is a type of security vulnerability where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database). When another user (often an admin) views the stored data, the script is executed in their browser.

In this case Anyone can submit an event request with input fields. Since the input is not sanitized or escaped, an attacker can inject a malicious script into the request (e.g., <script>alert('document.domain')</script>). When an admin opens that request, the script runs in their browserâ€”potentially stealing cookies, session data, or performing unwanted actions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. **Book the service using the URL:**
    ```
    https://domain.com/book-services.php?bookid=1
    ```
    ![Service Page](./images/servicepage.png)

2. **Fill in the form and submit the data.**  
   For testing, use the name "test" and phone number "9999999999".

3. **Once submitted, visit the status page:**
    ```
    https://domain.com/status.php
    ```

4. **Enter the name ("test") and phone number ("9999999999").**

5. **Click "View Details" to access the booking details.**
    ![Request Page](./images/status-view-details.png)

6. **You will be redirected to the `request-details.php` page.**

7. **On the request details page, notice the two parameters: `bid` and `bookingid`.**  
    ![Request Page](./images/request-page.png)

8. **Modify the `bookingid` by either increasing or decreasing the value.**

9. **You will now be able to see another user's personal information, such as phone number, email, name, and event details.**

## Impact of IDOR Vulnerability

* **Confidentiality Breach**: Attackers can access sensitive personal information, including phone numbers, email addresses, and other private details of other users without authorization.
  
* **Data Exposure**: Unauthorized users may view or steal booking details and other private records, which could lead to identity theft or misuse of the information.

* **Privacy Violation**: Personal data is exposed to unauthorized users, violating privacy for individuals whose information is accessed without consent.

## Recommended Mitigations

1. **Implement Authorization Checks:**
   - Ensure the system enforces strict authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data. The `bid` parameter (user ID) should be validated against the `bookingid` to guarantee the user only accesses their own booking details.

2. **Use Indirect References:**
   - Replace direct object references (like `bid` and `bookingid`) with indirect references such as hashed tokens, UUIDs, or random values. This prevents users from easily manipulating URLs to access data they shouldn't have.

3. **Implement Contextual Access Control:**
   - Enforce contextual access control based on user-specific data. For example, when accessing booking details, ensure that the `bookingid` matches the user's `bid` or is otherwise restricted to the user's own bookings.
